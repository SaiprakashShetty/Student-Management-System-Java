# Student-Management-System-Java
This a simple console-based user interface that prompts the user to enter student details (name, roll number, and marks). After the user enters the details, the program appends the entered details along with the calculated grade to a file named “student.txt”. The user is then asked if they want to continue entering student details. If the user enters “Y”, the program continues to prompt for student details. If the user enters “N”, the program stops prompting for student details and reads the student details from the file and displays them.
